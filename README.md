# PostmanTokenAutomationScripts
Automate bearer token management in Postman for streamlined API calls. Simplify workflows and save time with these scripts.

# Scripts Included:

bearerTokenScript: This script allows you to generate new bearer tokens with specific access permissions for your APIs. It automates the token creation process, by saving your API's login access token from the Cookies, and saving it to a Global variable in Postman to be reused. Reducing the need for manual token management.

scriptToJWTToken: This script helps you to convert the token value from bearerTokeScript, to a JWT token.

# How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Import the scripts into Postman as Test scripts.
Customize the scripts to suit your specific token generation, refresh, and revocation requirements.
Integrate these scripts into your Postman collections for a seamless and efficient API testing and management process.

# Contributions:
Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements, reporting issues, or enhancing the scripts. Together, we can make this tool even more valuable for the Postman community.
